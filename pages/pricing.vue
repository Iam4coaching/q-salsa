<p>
Hello! I am Ilka Antoinette Maria, founder of iam4coaching and organizer of Q-salsa Rotterdam. My dream is to combine work and salsa, because I believe that dance can connect people. From my work as a coach, especially with people from the queer community, I see how important a safe workplace is.
