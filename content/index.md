# Do you want to swing those hips to salsa music?

#description
At Q-salsarotterdam in collaboration with Ketelbinkie you can dance salsa in a safe environment.
We are a multicultural team and offer lessons for the LHBTI community and allies.

We dance gender free, i.e. we focus on the role division "leader and follower" and not on the role division man/wom

# What is Q-Salsa?
At Q-salsa we dance the salsa called salsa cale√±a. This is a fast salsa that is mainly danced in Colombia. To learn this style well, we first do the dance steps individually. Then, when we have mastered the steps well, we will dance together.
